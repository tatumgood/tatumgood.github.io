    <h2>Loss Aversion Monetization Model</h>
    <h2>General Thoughts</h2>
  </body>
  <p class="indented-paragraph">Loss aversion is a natural human tendency that exists to keep us from incurring losses. That being said, it is essential to know how to avoid loss aversion to prevent it from influencing our decisions, especially when there are potential gains to be made. There are two main strategies we can use to fight back against this bias: framing and putting loss into perspective.</p>

<p class="indented-paragraph"><b>Framing:</b>
The way that a transaction is framed can significantly influence an individual’s perception of loss aversion. Phrasing a question as a loss may increase loss aversion, while phrasing that same question as a gain may reduce loss aversion, leading to a more calculated response. When proposing a transaction, try framing the options in a way that highlights the potential benefits that can be achieved, rather than emphasizing the risks.</p>

<p class="indented-paragraph"><b>Putting Loss into Perspective:</b>
A simple way to tackle loss aversion is to ask ourselves what the worst outcome would be if the course of action was taken. Usually, this helps us put loss and the strong associated feelings with it into perspective. This way, we can get over our fears and better rationalize if it is worth making a decision or not.</p>

<h2>Next Steps?</h2>
<p class="indented-paragraph"> <b>Allocation Strategy:</b> Rather than trying to perfectly time market sentiment, and abide by the old adage of letting your winners run, investors are advised to rebalance portfolios periodically, according to a rules-based methodology.</p>

<p class="indented-paragraph"> <b>Strategic Investment:</b> For example, constant ratio plans keep the aggressive and conservative portions of a portfolio set at a fixed ratio. To maintain the target weights—typically of stocks and bonds—the portfolio is periodically rebalanced by selling outperforming assets and buying underperforming ones. This runs counter to momentum investing, which is pro-cyclical.</p>
